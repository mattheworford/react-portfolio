  bio: [
    "Until my sophomore year of college, the world of technology represented a daunting " +
    "mystery I figured I would never understand. Fortunately, that fear turned into curiosity, " +
    "leading me to sign up for a computer science class. The course introduced me to data " +
    "structures and basic algorithms and was lead by a professor dead set on changing our " +
    "perspective on programming. He urged us to look at it as an exercise in problem-solving " +
    "and domain modeling that should be enjoyed rather than avoided. I guess that’s when I " +
    "caught ‘the bug,’ and I never looked back.",
    "Outside of school and work, which you can read about in my portfolio, I'm an avid skier " +
    "and biker. As a result, much of my interest in technology stems from the ways it has been " +
    "integrated into the world of outdoor sports. I still see a lot of potential for growth " +
    "both inside and outside of that industry as countless companies could stand to learn from " +
    "the adaptability it demands."
